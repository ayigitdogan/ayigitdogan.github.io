Hi, as a senior student who is about to graduate, I have created this blog to share my works and leisure-time activities.

My main field of interest is computational biology. During the college years, I have tried to build a strong background in data analytics and optimization. Currently, I am practicing bioinformatics algorithms and optimization of healthcare systems.

I like running, reading comics, and watching movies. Check my reading and watching diaries on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/ayigitdogan) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/ayigitdogan/)!
