## Introduction

East-West Airlines is trying to learn more about its customers. Key
issues are their flying patterns, earning and use of frequent flyer
rewards, and use of the airline credit card. The task is to identify
customer segments via clustering. The file *EastWestAirlines.xlsx*
contains information on 4000 passengers who belong to an airlineâ€™s
frequent flier program. For each passenger the data include information
on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent
miles in the last year. The goal is to try to identify clusters of
passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of
targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers.

## Hierarchical Clustering

Applying hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and complete
linkage:

``` r
# Applying hierarchical clustering

dm_a            <- dist(data.scaled,                    
                        method      = "euclidean")  # Dissimilarity matrix (Euclidean distance)

hc.complete.a   <- hclust(dm_a,
                          method    = "complete")   # Hierarchical clustering using complete linkage

sil.widths.a    <- c()                              # Empty vector to store silhouette widths
                                                    # for different values of K

for (i in 2:10) {                                   # The for loop that generates cluster sets and
                                                    # calculates their respective silhouette widths
    
    clust               <- cutree(hc.complete.a, k = i)
    
    sil                 <- silhouette(clust, dm_a)
    
    sil.widths.a[i-1]   <- mean(sil[, c("sil_width")])    
    
}

results_a <- data.frame(k = 2:10, sil.widths.a)     # Storing the results in a data frame

results_a                                           # Viewing the results
```

    ##    k sil.widths.a
    ## 1  2    0.4704091
    ## 2  3    0.5318787
    ## 3  4    0.4645971
    ## 4  5    0.4167248
    ## 5  6    0.4172319
    ## 6  7    0.4161869
    ## 7  8    0.3912069
    ## 8  9    0.3519030
    ## 9 10    0.3522325

As can be seen in the above table, K = 3 yields the highest silhouette
width, which is 0.53, implying that 3 is the appropriate number of
clusters to be used.

The next step is to compare the cluster centroids to characterize the
different clusters and try to give each cluster a label. To check the
final state of the clusters, the clustering with the best k value can be
performed as follows:

``` r
# Performing the best clustering

hc.best.a     <- cutree(hc.complete.a, 
                        k = results_a[which.max(results_a$sil.widths.a), 1])

table(hc.best.a)
```

    ## hc.best.a
    ##    1    2    3 
    ## 2526 1469    4

The above results indicate that two of the clusters dominates the data
set, while the other one includes only 4 observations.

``` r
# Creating a table that displays the centroids of two clusters

data.w.clusters <- mutate(data, Cluster = hc.best.a)

first.cluster   <- data.w.clusters[data.w.clusters$Cluster == 1, ]

second.cluster  <- data.w.clusters[data.w.clusters$Cluster == 2, ]

third.cluster   <- data.w.clusters[data.w.clusters$Cluster == 3, ]

centroids       <- data.frame("1" = colMeans(first.cluster),
                              "2" = colMeans(second.cluster),
                              "3" = colMeans(third.cluster)     )

print(round(centroids, 2))
```

    ##                         X1       X2        X3
    ## Balance           59791.06 97189.59 131999.50

    ## Cluster               1.00     2.00      3.00

To obtain more insights about the clusters, centroids can be compared to
the quartiles:

``` r
summary(data)
```

The three obtained clusters seem to be representing customer groups with
different activity rates.

The third cluster have extremely high activity, when the averages of
activity in the last year, bonus usage, and traveled miles of these
customers are considered. Most of the features have higher average than
the third quartile for this group. It can also be said that they are
relatively new customers.

The first cluster consists of regular customers who travel occasionally.
The second cluster have higher bonus rates and traveled distances in the
last year, along with longer relationships with the company.

Based on these insights, the customers in the first, second, third
clusters can be labelled as *usual customers*, *loyal customers*, and
*super customers*, respectively.

To check the stability of the clusters, a random 5% of the data (200
observations) can be removed, and the analysis can be repeated with the
modified data set.

``` r
# Dropping 200 random rows from the data set

set.seed(seed)

drop        <- as.numeric(sample.int(3999, 200, replace = FALSE))

sliced.data <- data.scaled[-drop, ]

# Repeating the analysis

dm_b            <- dist(sliced.data,                    
                        method = "euclidean")       

hc.complete.b   <- hclust(dm_b,
                          method = "complete")      

sil.widths.b    <- c()                              

for (i in 2:10) {                                   
                                                    
    
    clust               <- cutree(hc.complete.b, k = i)
    
    sil                 <- silhouette(clust, dm_b)
    
    sil.widths.b[i-1]   <- mean(sil[, c("sil_width")])    
}

results_b <- data.frame(k = 2:10, sil.widths.b)       

results_b
```

    ##    k sil.widths.b
    ## 1  2    0.4702675
    ## 2  3    0.5338807
    ## 3  4    0.4796374
    ## 4  5    0.3835390
    ## 5  6    0.3782369
    ## 6  7    0.3918081
    ## 7  8    0.3687406
    ## 8  9    0.3698451
    ## 9 10    0.3717370

``` r
# Checking the new clusters

hc.best.b <- cutree(hc.complete.b, 
                    k = results_b[which.max(results_b$sil.widths.b), 1])

table(hc.best.b)
```

    ## hc.best.b
    ##    1    2    3 
    ## 2387 1408    4

Excluding 200 random observations did not cause dramatic changes in the
clustering results. Considering the general non-robustness problem with
clustering methods, it can be concluded that the current model is not
fragile against the changes in the data set and gives useful insights.

## K-Means Clustering

Using K-Means algorithm with different number of clusters and
determining the best number of clusters using the silhouette index:

``` r
# Applying k-means clustering

dm_c            <- dist(data.scaled,
                        method = "euclidean")

sil.widths.c    <- c()

for (i in 2:10) {                                   
    
    clust               <- kmeans(data.scaled, 
                                  centers   = i, 
                                  nstart    = 50)
    
    sil                 <- silhouette(clust$cl, dm_c)
    
    sil.widths.c[i-1]   <- mean(sil[, c("sil_width")])    
}

results_c <- data.frame(k = 2:10, sil.widths.c)

results_c 
```

    ##    k sil.widths.c
    ## 1  2    0.5359305
    ## 2  3    0.4648453
    ## 3  4    0.4748377
    ## 4  5    0.4430672
    ## 5  6    0.4037918
    ## 6  7    0.3909657
    ## 7  8    0.3803502
    ## 8  9    0.3416435
    ## 9 10    0.3452961

``` r
# Checking the clusters obtained by using the best k value

km.best <- kmeans(data.scaled, 
                  centers   = results_c[which.max(results_c$sil.widths.c), 1], 
                  nstart    = 50)

table(km.best$cl)
```

    ## 
    ##    1    2 
    ## 1481 2518

Setting K = 2 yields the highest silhouette width, which is 0.54,
implying that 2 is the appropriate number of clusters to be used. It
seems like K-Means clustering algorithm suggests that super customer is
not an important insight.

## Final Comments

Since major part of the customers fall into the first cluster in
hierarchically clustered data, setting these customers as target
audience is reasonable. Increasing the number of reward point campaigns
might potentially convert these usual customers to loyal customers.
Special campaigns and discounts for the loyal customers would also be
useful to keep these customers loyal, or event convert them to super
customers.

For the clusters obtained by K-Means algorithm, similar strategy can be
used by picking the second cluster as the main target audience due to
the higher number of observations fall into this set. The absence of
super customers is not a decision criteria since their amount is
negligible.
